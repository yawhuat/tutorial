                <h1>STRATEGY TO <b><i>IMPROVE MATH</i></b></h1> 
                <p>
        
                    Structured approach to teaching mathematics by customizing worksheets after each lesson and integrating continuous assessments is a methodical way to reinforce learning and ensure ongoing improvement. Here's a breakdown of each step: <br><br>
        
        <b>Steps 1-8: Customizing worksheets after each lesson</b><br>
        
        Each lesson focuses on a specific mathematical concept, starting from basic arithmetic and progressing through directed numbers, algebra, geometry, trigonometry, statistics, and calculus.
        Customized worksheets tailored to the content covered in each lesson help reinforce learning and allow students to practice problems related to the specific topic they've just learned. <br><br>
        
        <b>Step 9: Continuous Assessment by merging all topics into one worksheet</b> <br>
        This step involves creating worksheets that incorporate questions from all previously covered topics. It helps students to review and apply their knowledge across various mathematical concepts in a combined setting.
        Merging topics helps reinforce connections between different areas of mathematics and tests the student's ability to integrate their learning. <br><br>
        
        <b>Step 10: Repeat and continuous assessments for all topics by mixing and creating a healthy balance ratio of questions per chapter</b><br>
        Continuous practice through mixed questions from different topics helps solidify understanding and application of concepts. Repeatedly solving mixed questions enhances retention and mastery of the material.
        The goal of achieving a minimum of 60% in Math Exam sets a measurable target for students to work towards. <br><br>
        
        <b>Step 11: Start practicing past year papers</b><br>
        Practicing past year papers helps familiarize students with the exam format, question types, and level of difficulty they might encounter.
        Solving past papers also serves as a comprehensive review and allows students to gauge their readiness for the actual exam.
        <br><br>
        This structured approach, with its emphasis on customization, continuous practice, and assessment, provides a clear pathway for students to gradually build their mathematical skills and confidence. It ensures that students have a solid foundation in various mathematical concepts and are well-prepared for their exams by integrating continuous revision and practice.
